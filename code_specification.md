# Overview Logic

## An higher architecture of ArduCopter:
![New VM](./pics/copter-architecture.png)

What this really mean is that,there is a Main loop that take control of the simulation of the copter vehicle for the entire copter program. Which is take control by the file [Copter.cpp](https://github.com/xpan11/Arducopter/blob/master/ArduCopter/Copter.cpp) Then the Main loop with run different flight mode base on the desire of user, subsequently different mode will run the [Position contro](https://github.com/xpan11/Arducopter/blob/master/libraries/AC_AttitudeControl/AC_PosControl.cppï¼‰ and [Attitute control](https://github.com/xpan11/Arducopter/blob/master/libraries/AC_AttitudeControl/AC_AttitudeControl.cpp) differently to modify those important parameter(Throttle, Yaw, Pithch, Roll)
